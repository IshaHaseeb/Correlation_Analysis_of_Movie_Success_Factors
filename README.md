# Correlation_Analysis_of_Movie_Success_Factors-_Budget_Ratings_and_Audience_Engagement

In this analysis, we explore the relationships between various factors that contribute to the success of movies, using a dataset of 6,820 films released between 1986 and 2016. Key metrics such as budget, box office gross, IMDb scores, user votes, and runtime are examined to identify correlations and potential insights about the movie industry's dynamics.

Using:
 1. pandas
 2. numpy
 3. seabor
 4. matplotlib

From the analysis, the following insights were drawn:
 1.	Budget and Gross Revenue: There is a moderate to strong positive correlation between a movie's budget and its box office revenue, suggesting that films with larger budgets tend to generate higher gross revenues.
 2.	Votes and IMDb Score: A positive correlation is observed between the number of user votes and a movie's IMDb rating. Movies that receive more attention and votes generally score higher on IMDb, indicating that popular films tend to be 
    well-received by audiences.
 3.	Runtime and Gross/Score: While longer movies tend to have slightly higher revenues, the correlation with IMDb ratings is weaker, suggesting that runtime is not a primary determinant of a movieâ€™s critical reception but may impact its 
    box office performance.
These findings provide valuable insights into how different factors influence movie success, and can help stakeholders in the movie industry make data-driven decisions regarding production and marketing strategies.
